Pick and place a ball using Lego Mindstorm EV3 robotic arm

# Introduction 
Manipulators, versatile systems designed for precise control and execution of tasks, consist of three rotary actuating motors: Motor A, Motor B, and Motor C. Complementing these motors are five touch sensors, with Touch Sensor #1 and Touch Sensor #2 providing essential feedback, and three encoders (Motor A encoder, Motor B encoder, and Motor C encoder) ensuring accurate control. This integrated network of motors and sensors equips the manipulator for intricate pick and-place operations, showcasing adaptability and precision in various tasks.

# Components:
   1. Servo Motors and Encoders
   2. Gear boxes
   3. Touch sensors
   4. Ultrasonic sensors
   5. Kinematic Limitations

      In the below figure, the manipulator comprises five links (Link-1 to Link-4), each with specified lengths. Link-1 and Link-2 are rigidly connected at an obtuse 135° angle, while Link-4 stays perpendicular 
    to the ground.
